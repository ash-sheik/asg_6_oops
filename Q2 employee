Create a Python module named employee that contains a class Employee with attributes name, salary and methods get_name() and get_salary(). 
Write a program to use this module to create an object of the Employee class and display its name and salary

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary

    def get_name(self):
        return self.name

    def get_salary(self):
        return self.salary

from employee import Employee

# Creating an Employee object
emp = Employee("Alice Johnson", 60000)

# Displaying employee details
print("Employee Name:", emp.get_name())
print("Employee Salary:", emp.get_salary())
